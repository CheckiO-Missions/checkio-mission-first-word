        First of all you can use 
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=replace#str.replace'>str.replace()</a>
        method to replace dots and commas with spaces.

        I need some help to proceed with the mission
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        "replace" is work like that:
        <pre class="brush: python">
        text = "...hello..."
        text = text.replace('.', ' ')
        "   hello   "</pre>
        Than you can use
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.strip'>str.strip()</a>
        method to delete all spaces at the begin and at the end of the string.

        I have gone half way through. Need help!

    <div class="answer">
        "strip" is work like that:
        <pre class="brush: python">
        text = "   hello   "
        text = text.strip()
        "hello"</pre>
        When you have pure string with words and spaces only, you can
        <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=split#str.split'>split</a> it.

        I am stuck. I need a small hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        "split" is work like that:
        <pre class="brush: python">
        text = "hello dude"
        text = text.split()
        ["hello", "dude"]</pre>
        The last thing you should do - is to find the first element in you list of words.<br>
        Use indices like that:
        <pre class="brush: python">
        text = ["hello", "dude"]
        text[1] ==> "dude"</pre>.
